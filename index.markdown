title: ReactiveX - Intro
---

### ReactiveX is a set of libraries for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and fluent query operators.

### It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O.
