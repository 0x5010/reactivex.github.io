<h1>backpressure operators</h1>
<h3>strategies for coping with Observables that produce items more rapidly than their observers consume them</h3>

<p>
 In ReactiveX it is not difficult to get into a situation in which an Observable is emitting items
 more rapidly than an operator or observer can consume them. This presents the problem of what to do
 with such a growing backlog of unconsumed items.
</p><p>
 For example, imagine using the <a href="zip.html"><span class="operator">Zip</span></a> operator to
 zip together two infinite Observables, one of which emits items twice as frequently as the other. A
 naive implementation of the operator would have to maintain an ever-expanding buffer of items
 emitted by the faster Observable to eventually combine with items emitted by the slower one. This
 could cause ReactiveX to seize an unwieldy amount of system resources.
</p><p>
 There are a variety of strategies with which you can exercise flow control and backpressure in
 ReactiveX in order to alleviate the problems caused when a quickly-producing Observable meets a
 slow-consuming observer, which include, in some ReactiveX implementations, reactive pull
 backpressure and some backpressure-specific operators.
</p><p>
 A <dfn>cold Observable</dfn> emits a particular sequence of items, but can begin emitting this
 sequence when its observer finds it to be convenient, and at whatever rate the observer desires,
 without disrupting the integrity of the sequence. For example if you convert a static iterable into
 an Observable, that Observable will emit the same sequence of items no matter when it is later
 subscribed to or how frequently those items are observed. Examples of items emitted by a cold
 Observable might include the results of a database query, file retrieval, or web request.
</p><p>
 A <dfn>hot Observable</dfn> begins generating items to emit immediately when it is created.
 Subscribers typically begin observing the sequence of items emitted by a hot Observable from
 somewhere in the middle of the sequence, beginning with the first item emitted by the Observable
 subsequent to the establishment of the subscription. Such an Observable emits items at its own
 pace, and it is up to its observers to keep up. Examples of items emitted by a hot Observable might
 include mouse &amp; keyboard events, system events, or stock prices.
</p><p>
 When a cold Observable is multicast (when it is converted into a connectable Observable and its
 <a href="connect.html"><span class="operator">Connect</span></a> method is called), it effectively
 becomes hot and for the purposes of backpressure and flow-control it should be treated as a hot
 Observable.
</p><p>
 Cold Observables are ideal for the reactive pull model of backpressure implemented by some
 implementations of ReactiveX (which is described elsewhere). Hot Observables typically do not cope
 well with a reactive pull model, and are better candidates for other flow control strategies, such
 as the use of the operators described on this page, or operators like
 <a href="buffer.html"><span class="operator">Buffer</span></a>, 
 <a href="sample.html"><span class="operator">Sample</span></a>, 
 <a href="throttle.html"><span class="operator">Throttle</span></a>, or
 <a href="window.html"><span class="operator">Window</span></a>.
</p>

  {% lang_operator RxGroovy onBackpressureBlock onBackpressureBuffer onBackpressureDrop %}
    <p>
     RxGroovy implements reactive pull backpressure, and many of its operators support that form of
     backpressure. It also has three operators that you can apply to Observables that have not been
     written to support backpressure:

  {% lang_operator RxJS controlled pausable pausableBuffered stopAndWait windowed %}
    <p>
     RxJS implements backpressure by transforming an ordinary Observable into a
     <code>ControlledObservable</code> with the <code>controlled</code> operator. This forces the
     Observable to respect pull <code>request</code>s from its observer rather than pushing items on
     its own initiative.
    </p>
    <figure class="variant">
     <img src="images/bp.stopAndWait.png" style="width:100%;" alt="stopAndWait" />
     <figcaption><p>
      As an alternative to using <code>request</code> to pull items from a
      <code>ControlledObservable</code>, you may apply the <code>stopAndWait</code> operator to it.
      This operator will request a new item from the Observable each time its observers&#8217;
      <code>onNext</code> routine receives the latest item.
     </p></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="variant">
     <img src="images/bp.windowed.png" style="width:100%;" alt="windowed" />
     <figcaption><p>
      A second possibility is to use the <code>windowed(</code><i>n</i><code>)</code>. This behaves
      similarly to <code>stopAndWait</code> but has an internal buffer of <i>n</i> items, which
      allows the <code>ControlledObservable</code> to run somewhat ahead of the observer from time
      to time. <code>windowed(1)</code> is equivalent to <code>stopAndWait</code>.
     </p></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
     There are also two operators that convert an ordinary Observable into at
     <code>PausableObservable</code>.
    </p>
    <figure class="variant">
     <img src="images/bp.pausable.png" style="width:100%;" alt="pausable" />
     <figcaption><p>
      If you call the <code>pause</code> method of a <code>PausableObservable</code> created with
      the <code>pausable</code> operator, it will drop (ignore) any items emitted by the underlying
      source Observable until such time as you call its <code>resume</code> method, whereupon it
      will continue to pass along emitted items to its observers.

     <figcaption><p>
      If you call the <code>pause</code> method of a <code>PausableObservable</code> created with
      the <code>pausableBuffered</code> operator, it will buffer any items emitted by the underlying
      source Observable until such time as you call its <code>resume</code> method, whereupon it
      will emit those buffered items and then continue to pass along any additional emitted items to
      its observers.
