    You can combine the output of multiple Observables so that they act like a single Observable, by
    using the <span class="operator">Merge</span> operator.
   </p><p>
    Merge may interleave the items emitted by the merged Observables (a similar operator,
    <a href="concat.html"><span class="operator">Concat</span></a>, does not interleave items, but
    emits all of each source Observable&#8217;s items in turn before beginning to emit items from
    the next source Observable).
   </p><p>
    As shown in the above diagram, an <code>onError</code> notification from any of the source
    Observables will immediately be passed through to observers and will terminate the merged
    Observable. In many ReactiveX implementations there is a second operator,
    <span class="operator">MergeDelayError</span>, that changes this behavior &mdash; reserving
    <code>onError</code> notifications until all of the merged Observables complete and only then
    passing it along to the observers:

      For example, the following code merges the <code>odds</code> and <code>evens</code> into a
      single Observable. (The <code>subscribeOn</code> operator makes <code>odds</code> operate
      on a different thread from <code>evens</code> so that the two Observables may both emit items
      at the same time, to demonstrate how <span class="operator">Merge</span> may interleave these
      items.)
     </p>
     <h4>Sample code:</h4>
     <div class="code groovy"><pre>
odds  = Observable.from([1, 3, 5, 7]).subscribeOn(someScheduler);
evens = Observable.from([2, 4, 6]);

Sequence complete</pre></div>
     <p>
      Instead of passing multiple Observables (up to nine) into <code>merge</code>, you could also
      pass in a <code>List&lt;&gt;</code> (or other Iterable) of Observables, an Array of
      Observables, or even an Observable that emits Observables, and <code>merge</code> will merge
      their output into the output of a single Observable:
     </p>

      <img src="IMAGES/merge.io.png" width="640" alt="merge(List)" />
     </figure>
     <p>
      If you pass in an Observable of Observables, you have the option of also passing in a value
      indicating to <code>merge</code> the maximum number of those Observables it should attempt to
      be subscribed to simultaneously. Once it reaches this maximum subscription count, it will
      refrain from subscribing to any other Observables emitted by the source Observable until such
      time as one of the already-subscribed-to Observables issues an <code>onCompleted</code>
      notification.
     </p><p>
      The instance version of <code>merge</code> is <code>mergeWith</code>, so, for example, in the
      code sample above, instead of writing <code>Observable.merge(odds,evens)</code> you could also
      write <code>odds.mergeWith(evens)</code>.
     </p><p>
      If any of the individual Observables passed into <code>merge</code> terminates with an
      <code>onError</code> notification, the Observable produced by <code>merge</code> itself will
      immediately terminate with an <code>onError<code> notification. If you would prefer a merge
      that continues emitting the results of the remaining, error-free Observables before reporting
      the error, use <code>mergeDelayError</code> instead.
     </p>
     <figure>
      <img src="IMAGES/mergeDelayError.png" width="640" alt="mergeDelayError" />
     </figure>
     <p>
      <code>mergeDelayError</code> behaves much like <code>merge</code>. The exception is when one
      of the Observables being merged terminates with an <code>onError</code> notification. If this
      happens with <code>merge</code>, the merged Observable will immediately issue an
      <code>onError</code> notification and terminate. <code>mergeDelayError</code>, on the other
      hand, will hold off on reporting the error until it has given any other non-error-producing
      Observables that it is merging a chance to finish emitting their items, and it will emit those
      itself, and will only terminate with an <code>onError</code> notification when all of the
      other merged Observables have finished.
     </p><p>
      Because it is possible that more than one of the merged Observables encountered an error,
      <code>mergeDelayError</code> may pass information about <em>multiple</em> errors in the
      <code>onError</code> notification (it will never invoke the observer&#8217;s
      <code>onError</code> method more than once). For this reason, if you want to know the nature
      of these errors, you should write your observers&#8217; <code>onError</code> methods so that
      they accept a parameter of the class <code>CompositeException</code>.
     </p><p>
      <code>mergeDelayError</code> has fewer variants. You cannot pass it an Iterable or Array of
      Observables, but you can pass it an Observable that emits Observables or between one and
      nine individual Observables as parameters. There is not an instance method version of
      <code>mergeDelayError</code> as there is for <code>merge</code>.

     <p>
      The first variant of <code>merge</code> is an instance operator that takes a variable number
      of Observables as parameters, merging each of these Observables with the source (instance)
      Observables to produce its single output Observable.
     </p><p>
      This first variant of <code>merge</code> is found in the following distributions:

     <ul>
      <li><code>rx.js</code></li>
      <li><code>rx.compat.js</code></li>
      <li><code>rx.lite.js</code></li>
      <li><code>rx.lite.compat.js</code></li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The second variant of <code>merge</code> is a prototype (class) operator that accepts two
      parameters. The second of these is an Observable that emits the Observables you want to merge.
      The first is a number that indicates the maximum number of these emitted Observables that you
      want <code>merge</code> to attempt to be subscribed to at any moment. Once it reaches this
      maximum subscription count, it will refrain from subscribing to any other Observables emitted
      by the source Observable until such time as one of the already-subscribed-to Observables
      issues an <code>onCompleted</code> notification.

      <code>mergeAll</code> is like this second variant of <code>merge</code> except that it does
      not allow you to set this maximum subscription count. It only takes the single parameter of
      an Observable of Observables.

      <code>mergeDelayError</code> is similar to <code>merge</code> except that it will always
      emit all items from both Observables even if one of the Observables terminates with an
      <code>onError</code> notification before the other Observable has finished emitting items.

      <code>flatten</code> takes as its parameter an Observable that emits Observables. It merges
      the items emitted by each of these Observables to create its own single Observable sequence.
      A variant of this operator allows you to pass in an <code>Int</code> indicating the maximum
      number of these emitted Observables you want <code>flatten</code> to try to be subscribed to
      at any time. It it hits this maximum subscription count, it will refrain from subscribing to
      any other Observables emitted by the source Observable until such time as one of the
      already-subscribed-to Observables issues an <code>onCompleted</code> notification.

      <code>flattenDelayError</code> is similar to <code>flatten</code> except that it will always
      emit all items from all of the emitted Observables even if one or more of those Observables
      terminates with an <code>onError</code> notification before the other Observables have
      finished emitting items.
